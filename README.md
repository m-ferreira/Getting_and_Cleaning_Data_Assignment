# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Assignment



This is my project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" online course from Coursera! 

The R file (run_analysis.R) contains the steps I made according to the instructions below:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
each variable for each activity and each subject.

Note that the data required to follow this exercise is available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#run_analysys.R
-Contains the code to reach to the final data set.

#CODE_BOOK.md
-Contains information about variables and processess according to the code in R file.
