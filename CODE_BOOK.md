#CODE_BOOK

#My Getting and Cleaning Data course project:

The R file (run_analysis.R) countains the steps I made according to the instructions of the exercise. Running the code should
result in the generation of a tidy data set!

#Steps:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#R objects that will be displayed:

Base data information:

-var_names and var_corrected (from features.txt file that countains the names of the variables from the data sets)

-activity_labels (from the activity_labels.txt file that countains information about acitivity)

Data sets loaded from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip":

-trx, try, trs, train, tex, tey, tes, test

Data sets generated by me in order to get to the final dataset (tidy) from the 5th step:

-merged, extract, tidy 

#Key Variables for merging:

-subject

-activity
